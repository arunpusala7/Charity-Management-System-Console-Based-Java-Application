Charity Management System (Console-Based Java Application)

Project Overview :
The Charity Management System is a console-based Java application designed to streamline nonprofit operations. 
It offers a complete backend solution for managing donations, donors, campaigns, events, expenses, organizations, volunteers, and reports.
By combining Core Java programming with JDBC and MySQL, the project demonstrates how modular and enterprise-grade backend systems can be built efficiently.

Project Purpose :
-Automate and simplify nonprofit operations.
-Provide a menu-driven, modular backend for managing charity entities.
-Demonstrate Java OOP concepts, exception handling, and database integration.
-Deliver an enterprise-ready foundation for larger-scale applications.

Key Features :
-Comprehensive Module Management → Java classes for Campaign, Donor, Event, etc., using encapsulation and inheritance.
-Database Integration (JDBC + MySQL) → Secure CRUD operations with prepared statements.
-Error Handling & Validation → Custom exceptions (DuplicateCampaignIdException, InvalidDateFormatException, etc.) ensure reliability.
-Modular Architecture → Menu-driven MainDriver + DAO pattern for scalability and clean design.

Technologies Used :
-Java (Core OOP, Collections, Exception Handling)
-MySQL (via JDBC) for relational data storage
-DAO Pattern for structured and maintainable code
-ResourceBundle for database configuration

Impact & Vision
This project highlights proficiency in Java programming and database connectivity, showing the ability to design scalable backend systems. 
By automating charity workflows, it helps nonprofits focus more on their mission. With further development, it can evolve into a full-fledged enterprise-grade application.
